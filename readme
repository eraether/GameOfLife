Programmed in pure Java. The program generates a random palatte to be used for rendering the current game state. The rules and size of the board are also variable, allowing the user to create entirely new organisms by specifying when cells should live or die based on their neighbors.
Output of the console for a sample run, using the default rules for Conway's game of life. You can read more on wikipedia.
